write a fuzzy-match libary in go

The primary function is Match(), which takes a string and a list of
strings and returns all matches from the list, sorted by similarity to
the input string.  Each match includes the original string, the similarity
score, the number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to
change the input string into the match, and the position of the match in
the list.
